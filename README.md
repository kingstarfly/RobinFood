**Formal problem statement including definition of the target and brief description and outline of the approach. This is like an abstract and must not be more than 200 words. **

Our team intends to tackle the theme of Climate Action (SDG 13) by tackling food waste.

In Singapore, 763 million kg of food waste was generated in 2018. But one in ten Singaporeans still experience poverty and are food insecure. Seeing that one of the largest contributors to food waste is food caterers, we intend to create a mobile application that connects food caterers to charity organisations by facilitating the process of food collection.

Caterers can post photos and details of leftover food from an event, and charities can decide to accept postings. Thereafter, that charity will travel to the buffet location to collect food that they deem desirable.

Apart from food waste, we also aim to contribute to the movement of zero-waste by encouraging food caterers to donate their unused disposable cutleries and paper napkins to the same charity organisations.

We hope to incentivise food caterers to join as partners by publicly acknowledging their efforts and promoting their brand name. From the perspective of the caterers, it will fulfill their corporate social responsibility, improving their brand image. This is important because more customer preferences are shifting towards more sustainability.
